    Hi there, my name is Alex. 👋 I'm a Platform Engineer & Cloud Architect from Austria.
    Rooted in a strong background of Linux and Open Source, I specialized in orchestrating complex Cloud Native environments.
    I bridge the gap between low-level infrastructure and developer productivity by building resilient, self-healing platforms.
